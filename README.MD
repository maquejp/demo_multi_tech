# Multi Technology Demo

The goal of this project is to displays multiples ways to build the same application using different technologies.

I have started this project in January 2025... And it will takes time to covers everyhing ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„

## Technologies

### UIs

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)

It use [Vite](https://vite.dev/) to instanciate [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

##### Styling for SPAs

It is using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
